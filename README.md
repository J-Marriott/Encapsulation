# Calculate!

## Learning Objectives:

- Define 'behaviour' as 'the things a program does'
- Define 'class' as a 'convenient encapsulation of behaviour'
- Encapsulate behaviour into classes

## Overview

* The coach will build a very simple calculator without using classes, for these user stories:
```
As a mathematician
So I can add numbers
I want to add two numbers on my calc
```

```
As a mathematician
So I can subtract
I want to subtract two numbers on my calc
```

* You'll add functionality for this user story:
```
As mathematician
So I can enjoy the output of the calculator
I want a pretty output
```
* Encapsulate your behaviour in classes, following principle of SRP

## Instructions

1. Clone the starter repository using `git clone <repo url>`.
1. Install any project dependencies using `bundle install`.

> You may have to run `gem install bundler` to install Bundler first.

1. Implement pretty printing functionality. 
2. Wrap common behaviour into a class structure. That is; encapsulate common functionality within classes.
